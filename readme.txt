Cody wrecked my docking station
And then my laptop mother board crashed
And the laptop rebuild confused McAffee BitLocker
Which led to a wayward helpdesk rep hosing Office on the laptop
Which caused my AD creds to lock 
So 5 HD tickets later finally got the right PC dude 
Problem solved 
Moving to revenge planning stage
